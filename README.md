[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.3+. This package implements Sage Pay support for Omnipay.

## Installation

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply add it
to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "omnipay/sagepay": "~2.0"
    }
}
```

And run composer to update your dependencies:

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar update

## Basic Usage

The following gateways are provided by this package:

* SagePay_Direct
* SagePay_Server

For general usage instructions, please see the main [Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay)
repository.

### Basket format

By default [BasketXML](http://www.sagepay.co.uk/support/12/36/protocol-3-00-basket-xml) (Protocol 3.00) field will be sent (if item data is available) with the requests. However, a parameter "useOldBasketFormat" with value of TRUE can be passed to the config, which will in turn send old format [Basket](http://www.sagepay.co.uk/support/error-codes/3021-invalid-basket-format-invalid) field. Old format can be used to enable other Sage products better integrate with Sage Pay, as new BasketXML is not yet supported.
